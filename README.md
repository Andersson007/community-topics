This repository contains historical topics (as closed issues) for the Ansible Community (all interested people) and the [Ansible Community Steering Committee](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/steering/community_steering_committee.html) to discuss and vote on asynchronously.

Now the discussions happen on the [Ansible forum](https://forum.ansible.com).

See the [Community topics workflow](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/steering/community_steering_committee.html#community-topics-workflow) for the most relevant information.
